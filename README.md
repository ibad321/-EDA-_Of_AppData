# Exploratory Data Analysis and Logistic Regression on Google Play Store Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Logistic Regression on the Google Play Store dataset.

## Dataset
The Google Play Store dataset contains information about apps listed on the Google Play Store, including categories, ratings, reviews, sizes, and more.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to gain insights into the dataset through EDA and build a Logistic Regression model to predict a certain outcome (e.g., app rating, download counts) based on the available features.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Google-Play-Store-EDA.git
2.Open the Jupyter Notebook Google_Play_Store_EDA_Logistic_Regression.ipynb and run the cells to perform EDA and build the Logistic Regression model.

3.Modify the notebook to experiment with different features and parameters for the Logistic Regression model.

## Dependencies
- Python (>=3.6)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The EDA section provides insights into the distribution of app categories, ratings, and other key features.
The Logistic Regression model achieves a certain accuracy score or other relevant metrics, indicating its predictive performance.
